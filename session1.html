                <p>Thank you Salmon for all the lengdary things you've done for us! You're by far one of the greatest teachers I've ever had. All those amazing and hilarious times with you teaching us ruby on rails is easily the best part of my IX experience! I wish you could have stayed for longer. I wish you the best of luck, and a lifetime of happiness with your soon-to-be wife! Have an amazing new life, and don't forget us! :)</p>

                  Salman, Getting to know you has truly been an honor. You've been so much more than a great teacher -- you have been a phenomenal friend, mentor, and Bhangra partner since i got to Cape Town. Thank you for making this experience great for all of us (and for laughing at my mediocre puns). You'll be the first person to know whenever I'm in the Bay Area. Have a blast at the wedding and don't be a stranger! I'll miss you Brobi Wan Kenobi. - Struck

                <p>Salman, thank you infinitely for being such a spectacular lecturer and Ruby/Rails pro--you completely shaped my time at iXperience, and even all our excursions could not have given me as rewarding a summer had I not been learning about MVC, hearing about testing, and dying as I styled pages. That said, I will miss your crazy dance moves, wonderfully cute stories in front of Mizolis, and company at the bo-kaap even more than your lectures, and I hope you know you've been a role model and friend to me throughout your time here. I will miss you very much, and I better see you soon!! (perhaps at your wedding???? yes yes yes????? ;)) </p>

                <p>Hi friend! Thanks for teaching me things I never even knew about myself - like unbeknownst to most, I am secretly a kick-ass coder ;) More like, I am stubborn as all get out. Thanks for the encouraging words you shared without even knowing it probably, for dealing with my obnoxiousness, for sitting beside me in my distress and for re-filling my controllers and models with proper code (ohhh snazzy coder language!) and for making me smile. It is something I am most grateful for.</p>

                <p>I believe teaching is one of the hardest things to do. You may be the most skilled person in a particularly subject, and yet have no ability to explain concepts clearly and motivate your students. Although I am incredibly impressed with your ability to do both those things, what blows me away is your ability to teach your students important life lessons through lectures about computer programming. You are truly gifted and I sincerely thank you for being my teacher, friend and mentor through out these past two months.</p>

You advice in all of these areas has been influential; More importantly hanging out with you was one of the many reasons Cape Town feels like home. I hope married life treats you well!
