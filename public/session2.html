                <p>Salman, it has been incredible learning under your instruction, as not only a student but also a friend and fellow fast-breaker. I know that thanks to you, I'm a more cultured person today, walking away enlightened in bhangra, All Your Base, internet cat memes, and other debauchery. I hope we might someday cross paths again and carry on with drinking tea and discussing existence. All the best!</p>

                <p>It was a delight getting to be in your class. You have mastered something that so many teachers strive for-- balancing a playful, youthful energy that excites students with tough and unwavering high expectations that motivate them. I think I can speak on behalf of both Session 1 and Session 2 when I say that you truly made iXperience for us by fostering ambition in a fun and dynamic environment. I wish you and your lovely fiancee the best, and eagerly await a YouTube upload of your wedding's Bhangra battles! (And, perhaps you could maybe throw in a hip-hop song here or there...yeah?!) :)</p>

You were so understanding and supportive, and it really meant a lot that you listened, even to the things I wasn't saying. You have a great way with people, and that's why they gravitate towards you. Wishing you the very best at your wedding, and I hope to cross paths with you again soon :) </p>

I’ve enjoyed every minute of class (including all the cat videos we watched as well..). You’ve helped me learn so much and deepened my interest in coding. Wish you all the best with your upcoming wedding and all that future has await for you!</p>

                <p>Thank you so much Salman for being such an awesome teacher and making this such a fun experience. I came into this program not knowing a thing about coding and although I do not necessary want to become a professional coder when I grow up, I now understand the power that coders have that you talk about in almost every lecture. I definitely do feel extremely powerful with all the skills and tools that you have taught us. Thanks again for everything and keep the love for fries alive :) #flawless #wokeuplikedis </p>

                <p>Salman, thank you for being an outstanding instructor, mentor, and friend. Your class has been one of the funnest learning experiences I've had and inspires me to continue learning how to code well after iX. Learning how to dance Bhangra and killing it on the dance floor at Stones with you will always be highlights of my summer here in Cape Town. Lastly, learning about the Muslim religion and pushing myself to fast with you and understanding its purpose piques my interest in a culture I want to learn more about. Basically, you've taught me a lot. <br>Rest assured that whenever I come across an epic cat meme I'll send it your way. Hopefully we'll cross paths again in the U.S. and I wish you and Nida all the best! </p>

                <p>Salman, you flew 7,888 miles from the US to Cape Town and left your fiancee for 2 months just to teach a bunch of 20-somethings how to turn ideas into reality through programming. An outsider might think you're insane but I think you're awesome. Thanks for everything!</p>

                <p>Salman - you're definitely a huge reason this program is as amazing as it is! Nothing can compare to your obsession with cats, LOL-ing at the internetsss, Stones dancing, and embarrassing youtube videos. Thanks for being a spectacular lecturer, especially since we had over 30 in a row. I can't believe how much I learned in such a short amount of time. Good luck with the wedding and move to SanFran, and I hope we all keep in touch!</p>

You're one of the best teachers I've had not only in computer science but in any academic environment. We all appreciate you taking a chance on us and all your patience along the way.

I came in knowing zero about coding, and now I've built a fully-functional web app with the skills you gave us-- what a feeling. While I did learn a lot about coding, I learned even more about how to be a great human being. Your passion and enthusiasm are infectious, and I will forever respect your ability to bring that kind of energy to everything you do.. even while fasting. I am forever changed by this experience, so thank you for everything.<br>There will always be a seat for you at the banquet hall of King's Cross Castle in Gloucester, so don't be a stranger!</p>

I appreciate your attention to detail, and deeply respect your commitment to doing your best in all you do, be it developing a quality ruby/rails curriculum, or teaching a kickass Bhangra routine. Now that I have gained the basic tools, I look forward to continuing on this path, and I will forever owe you a debt of gratitude for showing me how to get started.<br>Check out the Vipassana meditation, and keep in touch!</p>
