                <p>Thank you Salmon for all the lengdary things you've done for us! You're by far one of the greatest teachers I've ever had. All those amazing and hilarious times with you teaching us ruby on rails is easily the best part of my IX experience! I wish you could have stayed for longer. I wish you the best of luck, and a lifetime of happiness with your soon-to-be wife! Have an amazing new life, and don't forget us! :)</p>

                <p>Salman, wow where to begin! Thank you so much for being you, for teaching and for inspiring. You have created a magical thing right here and your positive attitude and willingness to be involved in every single aspect of this program is priceless, and truly shows your dedication and love for educating and making a difference to those around you. I will be forever thankful that you agreed to join our iX family in Cape Town this year. This program is what it is because of you and not only have you inspired the students to be better human beings but you have ignited a flame within me too! Your story and the way you live your life is something I aspire my story to be like. Thank you my friend!  </p>

                <p>Thank you for you amazing presence in the IX house.<br>
                  You touched a lot of people's lives during your time here.<br>
                  I'm sure Ruby will miss you the most and will be even more grumpy when you leave.<br>
                  All of the best to the new chapter of your life that will start soon. May it be blessed!<br>
                  And thanks for the Bungra.... now I will only do that in clubs.

                <p>Salman, where do I start? My first memory of you was at Ricks cafe while you were still on a high from all the travel excitement- I remember chatting to you about how lucky we were to have the weather we had in Cape Town during winter and then looking across the road at the builders working on the unfinished IX house. I'm usually not someone that recalls these sorts of things but there was just something about your contagious smile and amazing attitude that I knew you were a perfect fit for our IX team. Although I know everybody at iXperience is sad to see you go, I feel honored to have shared my IX journey with you. We both have some big plans ahead of us and I'm almost positive that this won't be our last encounter :-) Thanks for everything you have done for IX and I wish you everything of the best for the future! </p>

                <p>Salman,<br>We couldn't have asked for a better lecturer to inaugurate the iX program. Your dedication and passion towards this program will undoubtably contribute to its overall success. You have been an inspiration to me, to the iX staff and most notably to the students.  I wish you all the best on this new, exciting part of your life, and hope to see you again in the future.<br>Cheers bru </p>

                <p>Salman, you’ve been an inspiration to me like no other: in your love for felines, dedication to good to music, and of course, your rad bhangra moves. But most of all, you held me to a higher standard, and pushed me to do the best I could—all while keeping a smile on both our faces. Know that you were teaching me as much as, if not more than, those enrolled in the class, and from you, I learned to be a better communicator, teacher, and friend. I sincerely hope our paths cross again!</p>

                <p>Salman, it goes without saying that you're probably one of the most fun-spirited persons I've met. The way you create an entertaining, engaging environment in class is every bit worth emulating. Going back, there will be so many lessons I will take from my time in and out of classroom with you. Iftar at Beluga took me years down memory lane, and it remains to be one of my best memories with you. :) PS: never had sushi for Iftar in my life before. Thank you for being an amazing mentor and friend. iX would not have been the same without you. <br>My best wishes for your new phase in life. Stay awesome!</p>
